WXZ Tools
=========

In this repository you can find tools for handling the new WXZ file format (spec to follow).

- `wxz-converter.php` allows to convert conventional WXR files to WXZ.
- `wxz-validator.php` validates WXZ files.

If you'd like to try using the new format, these WordPress plugins will allow you to do so (please be aware that things are still moving):
- [Export WXZ](https://github.com/akirk/export-wxz) will have WordPress generate WXZ files as export.
- [WordPress Importer (branch import-wxz)](https://github.com/akirk/wordpress-importer/tree/import-wxz) will add WXZ support to the importer plugin.
